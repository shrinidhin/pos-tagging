# pos-tagging
Objective:To Implement the Viterbi Algorithm while building an HMM based POS tagger and improve accuracy of the Simple Viterbi implementation.

The same has been demostrated using two different techniques.Their accuracies have been compared and the models have been evaluated on a small test set given in the TestSentences.txt file.
